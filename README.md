# Exam-Scheduler

## Instructions to Build and Run the Application

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- .NET SDK
- SQL Server
- Git (Optional but recommended for version control)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone the repository to your local machine using Git (or download and extract the ZIP file from GitHub).

2. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
   - Install frontend dependencies: `npm install`.
   - Start the frontend server: `npm start` (accessible at `http://localhost:3000`).

3. **Backend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
   - Restore backend dependencies and build: `dotnet restore` and `dotnet build`.
   - Update the database connection string in `appsettings.json`.
   - Apply database migrations: `dotnet ef database update`.

4. **Running the Application**:
   - Start the backend API server: `dotnet run` (accessible at `https://localhost:7166`).
   - Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Application Architecture (Simplified)

- **Frontend (React.js)**:
  - User Interface and User Interactions.
  - Communicates with Backend API.

- **Backend (ASP.NET Core)**:
  - Provides RESTful API Endpoints.
  - Handles Business Logic and Database Operations.
  - Communicates with SQL Server Database.

- **Database (SQL Server)**:
  - Stores Application Data (e.g., User Information, Exam Schedules).
  - Accessed and Manipulated by Backend API.
 
### Application Architecture

#### Frontend (React.js)

- **Components**: The frontend is built using React.js and organized into reusable components. These components encapsulate various parts of the user interface, such as forms, buttons, and navigation elements.

- **Routing**: React Router is used for client-side routing. It maps specific URLs to different React components, allowing for a single-page application (SPA) experience.

- **API Requests**: The frontend communicates with the backend API by making HTTP requests (e.g., POST, GET) to fetch or send data. Axios is commonly used to manage these requests.

#### Backend (ASP.NET Core)

- **Controllers**: ASP.NET Core includes controllers responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and returning appropriate responses. In your application, you likely have controllers for user management, exam scheduling, timetable generation, etc.

- **Models**: Models represent the data structures used by the application. These models define the structure of the data that the application works with. For example, you may have models for users, exams, timetable entries, etc.

- **Business Logic**: The backend contains business logic that processes data, enforces rules, and orchestrates interactions between different components. This logic might include tasks such as validating user input, scheduling exams, generating timetables, and database operations.

- **Entity Framework Core**: Entity Framework Core is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework used to interact with the database. It allows you to work with database entities as C# objects, which simplifies database operations.

- **Database**: The SQL Server database stores application data, including user information, exam schedules, and timetable details. Entity Framework Core manages the interaction between the application and the database.

- **API Endpoints**: The backend exposes a set of RESTful API endpoints that the frontend can call to perform various actions, such as creating users, scheduling exams, and generating timetables.

#### Database (SQL Server)

- **Tables**: The SQL Server database contains tables that correspond to the application's data models. For example, there may be tables for users, exams, timetable entries, and more.

- **Data**: The database stores data records in these tables, such as user accounts, exam details, and timetable entries.

- **Entity Relationships**: Relationships between entities (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) are defined using foreign keys and other constraints to establish connections between related data.

- **Entity Framework Core**: Entity Framework Core is responsible for mapping C# objects (models) to database tables and handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

### Summary

1. **Frontend**: Responsible for the user interface and interactions, making HTTP requests to the backend.

2. **Backend**: Manages business logic, handles HTTP requests, communicates with the database, and exposes API endpoints.

3. **Database**: Stores and manages application data, with tables corresponding to data models and relationships defined between entities.

This architecture separates concerns and promotes maintainability, scalability, and code reusability. It allows for efficient data flow from the user interface to the database and back, enabling the core functionality of the Exam Scheduling application.
